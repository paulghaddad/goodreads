# Inspiration

This project is inspired by the [thoughtbot Goodreads Challenge](https://forum.upcase.com/t/building-the-upcase-community/5161/37).

It will consist of a number of small projects to practice building a web
application in Python and Postgres.

# Project 1: Create data model and database

In this project, I designed the data model and created the database using
[Alembic](http://alembic.zzzcomputing.com/en/latest/index.html) to manage
database migrations.
